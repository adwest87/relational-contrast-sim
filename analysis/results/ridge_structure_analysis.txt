    CRITICAL RIDGE STRUCTURE: PHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS
    ============================================================
    
    The observed ridge structure α ≈ 0.13·β + 1.11 reveals important 
    insights about the phase transition mechanism:
    
    1. COUPLED ORDER PARAMETERS:
       - The linear relationship between β (weight coupling) and α (trace weight)
         indicates these are not independent order parameters
       - The system exhibits a co-dimensional phase transition where both
         parameters must adjust together to maintain criticality
       - Ridge slope dα/dβ ≈ 0.13 quantifies this coupling
    
    2. FINITE-SIZE SCALING ALONG RIDGE:
       - Peak positions follow the ridge: larger systems move to higher β, lower α
       - This systematic drift (Δβ ≈ +0.01, Δα ≈ -0.01 per size doubling) 
         maintains the ridge constraint α = 0.13β + 1.11
       - Suggests the ridge represents a line of critical points
    
    3. UNIVERSALITY CLASS INDICATORS:
       - γ/ν ≈ 2.0 suggests mean-field or 3D Ising-like behavior
       - Ridge structure is consistent with systems having competing interactions
       - The coupling between weight and metric sectors creates effective 
         long-range correlations
    
    4. PHASE TRANSITION MECHANISM:
       - The ridge likely separates two distinct phases:
         * Below ridge (low α): Localized/disconnected phase
         * Above ridge (high α): Delocalized/connected phase
       - The balance β vs α controls the competition between:
         * Weight concentration (β → high favors sparse weights)
         * Metric delocalization (α → high favors uniform metric)
    
    5. EMERGENT GEOMETRY INTERPRETATION:
       - The ridge may represent the boundary where a coherent geometric
         structure emerges from the discrete graph
       - Critical point marks the onset of long-range metric correlations
         necessary for emergent continuous geometry
    
    6. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:
       - To find critical points for new system sizes, follow the ridge
       - Extrapolated infinite-volume critical point: (β∞=2.935, α∞=1.465)
       - Ridge constraint reduces parameter space from 2D to effectively 1D
