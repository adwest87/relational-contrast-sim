# Detailed Comparison: Paper Physics vs Code Implementation

## Action Terms

| Component | Paper (Eq. 117-122) | graph.rs | Status |
|-----------|---------------------|----------|---------|
| **Triangle Term** | α Σ_△ Re tr(R_ij R_jk R_ki) | α Σ cos(θ_ij + θ_jk + θ_ki) | ✓ Simplified to U(1) |
| **Entropy Term** | β Σ w_ij ln w_ij | β Σ (-z_ij exp(-z_ij)) | ✓ Mathematically identical |
| **Spectral Term** | γ Σ (λ_n - λ̄)² | Not implemented | ❌ Missing |

## Variables

| Variable | Paper | graph.rs | Status |
|----------|-------|----------|---------|
| **Weights** | w_ij ∈ (0,1] | w_ij = exp(-z_ij) | ✓ Correct |
| **Gauge Fields** | G_ij ∈ SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) | θ_ij ∈ [0,2π) (U(1) only) | ⚠️ Simplified |
| **Combined** | R_ij = w_ij G_ij | Separate w_ij and θ_ij | ⚠️ Not combined |

## Observables

| Observable | Paper Says | Code Has | Status |
|------------|------------|----------|---------|
| **Spectral Dimension** | Key observable | Not computed | ❌ Missing |
| **Wilson Triangles** | Average tr(R_ij R_jk R_ki) | Computes cos sum | ✓ Simplified |
| **Laplacian Gap** | λ_2 - λ_1 | Not computed | ❌ Missing |
| **Magnetization** | Not defined | Complex M = Σ exp(iθ) | ❌ Wrong physics |
| **Susceptibility** | Not defined | χ = N(⟨|M|²⟩ - ⟨|M|⟩²) | ❌ Wrong physics |

## Mathematical Verification

### Entropy Equivalence
Paper: w ln(w)  
Code: -z exp(-z) where w = exp(-z)

Proof:
```
w ln(w) = exp(-z) ln(exp(-z))
        = exp(-z) × (-z)
        = -z exp(-z)
```
✓ IDENTICAL

### Force Calculation (HMC)
Paper (line 439): `grad = attr['w'] * np.log(attr['w'])`  
This gives: ∂S/∂w = ln(w) + 1

Our code equivalent:
```
∂S/∂z = ∂/∂z[-z exp(-z)]
       = -exp(-z) + z exp(-z)
       = exp(-z)(z - 1)
```
With w = exp(-z), this becomes: w(z - 1) = w(-ln(w) - 1) = -w(ln(w) + 1)

The negative sign difference is because ∂S/∂w vs ∂S/∂z have opposite signs.

## Symmetries

| Symmetry | Paper | Code | Status |
|----------|-------|------|---------|
| **Weight Symmetry** | w_ji = w_ij | Enforced | ✓ Correct |
| **Gauge Antisymmetry** | G_ji = G_ij^{-1} | θ_ji = -θ_ij | ✓ Correct for U(1) |
| **Dougal Invariance** | w → λw, Δt → λΔt | Has rescale() method | ✓ Correct |

## Physical Interpretation

| Aspect | Paper | Code | Impact |
|--------|-------|------|--------|
| **System Type** | Emergent spacetime | Magnetic system | ❌ Fundamental error |
| **Degrees of Freedom** | Relational weights | "Spins" | ❌ Wrong interpretation |
| **Phase Structure** | Pre-geometric → 4D spacetime | Magnetic phases | ❌ Wrong physics |
| **Critical Behavior** | Emergence of geometry | Magnetic transition | ❌ Wrong analysis |

## Missing Features

1. **Spectral gap calculation** - Essential for spacetime emergence
2. **Full gauge group** - Only U(1) implemented
3. **AIB projector** - Not implemented
4. **Fermions** - Not implemented
5. **Proper observables** - Using magnetic instead of geometric

## Correct Features

1. **Weight formulation** - Using z = -ln(w) is numerically sound
2. **Entropy mathematics** - Correctly implements w ln(w)
3. **Triangle term** - Correct for U(1) simplification
4. **Dougal rescaling** - Properly implemented
5. **Monte Carlo machinery** - Correct Metropolis algorithm

## Conclusion

The implementation has the correct mathematical structure but completely wrong physical interpretation. It's like having the right equation but solving for temperature when you should be solving for pressure. The fix requires:

1. Remove all magnetic concepts
2. Add spectral gap calculations
3. Reinterpret as geometry emergence
4. Keep the existing mathematical core

The entropy "error" was a false alarm - the math is correct. The real error is treating this as condensed matter physics instead of quantum gravity.
