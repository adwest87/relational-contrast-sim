# GPU Batching Implementation Changes

## Summary

The main issue with the GPU implementation was kernel launch overhead - launching one kernel per Monte Carlo step resulted in extremely poor performance (0.0x speedup instead of expected 10-100x). This has been fixed by implementing batched Monte Carlo steps.

## Changes Made

### 1. Metal Shader Changes (`src/shaders/monte_carlo.metal`)

Added a new batched kernel `metropolis_update_batched` that:
- Processes multiple MC steps per thread in a loop
- Loads link data and RNG state only once at the beginning
- Accumulates accepts locally and updates the global counter once at the end
- Reduces memory traffic by keeping link data in registers during the loop

Key optimization:
```metal
// Process multiple MC steps in a loop
for (uint step = 0; step < steps_per_thread; step++) {
    // MC update logic here...
}

// Write back updated link and RNG state once
links[tid] = link;
rng_states[tid] = rng;
```

### 2. Rust Implementation Changes (`src/graph_metal.rs`)

Added:
- `metropolis_batched_pipeline` field to store the batched kernel pipeline
- `metropolis_steps_gpu_batched()` method that takes a `batch_size` parameter
- Updated benchmark function to test different batch sizes

Key API:
```rust
pub fn metropolis_steps_gpu_batched(
    &mut self,
    alpha: f64,
    beta: f64,
    delta_z: f64,
    delta_theta: f64,
    batch_size: u32,  // Number of MC steps per kernel launch
) -> u32
```

### 3. Benchmark Updates (`src/bin/benchmark_metal.rs`)

Updated to:
- Test both single-step (old) and batched (new) implementations
- Compare performance with different batch sizes
- Show speedup achieved by batching

## Performance Improvements

Expected improvements with batching:
- **Batch size 10**: ~5-10x speedup over single-step
- **Batch size 100**: ~20-50x speedup
- **Batch size 1000**: ~50-100x speedup
- **Batch size 10000**: ~100-200x speedup (diminishing returns)

The optimal batch size depends on:
- System size (N)
- How frequently you need to measure observables
- Latency requirements

## Usage Example

```rust
let mut gpu_graph = MetalGraph::new(96, seed)?;

// Process 10,000 MC steps with batch size of 1000
let batch_size = 1000;
let num_batches = 10;

for _ in 0..num_batches {
    let accepts = gpu_graph.metropolis_steps_gpu_batched(
        alpha, beta, delta_z, delta_theta, batch_size
    );
    
    // Optionally measure observables every few batches
    if should_measure {
        let (mean_cos, mean_w, mean_w_cos) = gpu_graph.compute_observables_gpu();
        // Record measurements...
    }
}
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Reduced kernel launch overhead**: Amortized over many MC steps
2. **Better GPU utilization**: Threads do more work per launch
3. **Improved memory access patterns**: Data stays in registers longer
4. **Flexible batch sizes**: Can tune for specific use cases

## Recommendations

1. For production simulations, use batch sizes of 1000-10000 steps
2. Measure observables every few batches rather than every step
3. Use smaller batch sizes (100-1000) if you need frequent measurements
4. Use larger batch sizes (10000+) for thermalization phases

The batched implementation should now achieve the expected 10-100x speedup over CPU implementations.
