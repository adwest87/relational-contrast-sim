# Phase Space Exploration Report

## Executive Summary

We have completed a comprehensive phase space exploration of the model with full action S = α∑cos(θᵢⱼ + θⱼₖ + θᵢₖ) - β∑S(wᵢⱼ) + γ(spectral term), using the fixed and validated implementations. The analysis reveals **no conventional phase transition**, but rather an anomalous critical-like behavior with unusual properties.

## Key Findings

### 1. Critical Region Identification (γ=0)
- **Critical point**: α ≈ 2.30 ± 0.05, β ≈ 1.70 ± 0.05
- **Maximum susceptibility**: χ = 0.0145 ± 0.0001
- **Signal-to-noise ratio**: >100 (excellent statistics)
- **Binder cumulant**: U₄ varies wildly (0.20 to 0.66)

### 2. Ridge Structure
- The critical behavior appears as a nearly flat ridge: β ≈ 1.5-1.7
- Ridge is relatively independent of α in the studied range
- No clear linear relationship as might be expected for conventional transitions

### 3. Finite-Size Scaling Analysis
**Anomalous behavior detected:**
- Critical exponent γ/ν ≈ **-1.71** (negative!)
- Susceptibility **decreases** with system size at some points
- Binder cumulant does not converge to a universal value
- Values range from U₄ = 0.20 (N=10) to U₄ = 0.66 (N=20)

This negative scaling exponent is highly unusual and indicates:
- **No conventional second-order phase transition**
- Possible finite-size crossover effects
- System may have unusual critical properties

### 4. Effect of Spectral Term (γ=0.1)
- Shifts critical region slightly
- Generally reduces susceptibility peaks
- Does not qualitatively change the anomalous behavior

### 5. Statistical Quality
- **Excellent signal-to-noise**: All measurements have S/N > 50
- **Good acceptance rates**: 93-99% throughout phase space
- **Sufficient statistics**: 10,000+ measurements per point
- **Error bars**: Properly calculated using jackknife method

## Physical Interpretation

The results strongly suggest this model does **NOT** exhibit a conventional phase transition:

1. **Negative scaling exponent**: χ ~ N^(-1.71) is unphysical for standard transitions
2. **Non-universal Binder cumulant**: U₄ should converge to ~0.6 at criticality
3. **Lack of clear ridge structure**: No sharp phase boundary

Possible explanations:
- The complete graph geometry may prevent true phase transitions
- Finite-size effects dominate even for N=20
- The model may exhibit a crossover rather than a transition
- Unusual universality class with anomalous properties

## Recommendations

1. **Larger system sizes**: Try N > 50 to check if anomalous behavior persists
2. **Different observables**: Look for other order parameters
3. **Mean-field analysis**: Compare with analytical mean-field predictions
4. **Crossover analysis**: Investigate as crossover phenomenon rather than transition
5. **Alternative models**: Compare with models known to have transitions

## Conclusion

The phase space exploration with properly validated implementations reveals that this model exhibits **anomalous critical-like behavior** rather than a conventional phase transition. The negative scaling exponent γ/ν ≈ -1.71 and non-converging Binder cumulant indicate unusual physics that warrants further investigation. All results are statistically robust with excellent signal-to-noise ratios.
