# Project Organization Summary

The project files have been organized into a clear folder structure:

## Key Changes Made

1. **Binaries organized by purpose**:
   - Physics analysis tools moved to `src/bin/physics_analysis/`
   - Debug utilities moved to `src/bin/debug/`
   - Validation scripts moved to `src/bin/validation/`

2. **Publication materials consolidated**:
   - All papers now in unified `papers/` directory
   - New classical spin liquid paper in `papers/classical_spin_liquid/`
   - Includes LaTeX source, PDF, figures, and compilation script
   - Consistent with existing paper organization

3. **Data files centralized**:
   - All CSV files moved to `data/`
   - Easier to find and manage experimental results

4. **Scripts organized**:
   - Python visualization scripts in `scripts/`
   - Separate from source code for clarity

5. **Documentation improved**:
   - All reports, logs, and summaries in `docs/`
   - Clear separation from code and data

## Benefits

- **Cleaner root directory**: Only essential files remain at top level
- **Logical grouping**: Related files are together
- **Easier navigation**: Clear purpose for each directory
- **Better for version control**: Can ignore entire directories if needed
- **Professional structure**: Ready for open-source release or collaboration
