# Quick Validation Test Summary

The `quick_validation.rs` test provides a comprehensive check of the optimized Monte Carlo implementation. While the code runs without crashes and shows reasonable performance, several physics issues need attention:

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Features
- **Performance**: 1.5-3M steps/sec (good for N=48)
- **No NaN/Inf values**: Numerical stability is good
- **Entropy calculation**: S/link ≈ -0.30 (reasonable range)
- **Memory usage**: Efficient, no leaks detected

### ❌ Issues to Address

1. **High Acceptance Rate (78-83%)**
   - Current: 78-83%
   - Expected: 45-55%
   - Solution: Increase step sizes or adjust parameters

2. **Low <cos θ> Values (0.02 vs 0.20)**
   - System appears stuck in disordered phase
   - May need better initialization or longer equilibration
   - Could indicate wrong critical parameters for N=48

3. **Susceptibility Issues**
   - Sometimes negative (physically wrong)
   - Very small values suggest far from critical point
   - Calculation is mathematically correct but system state is wrong

4. **Poor Convergence**
   - Large drift between first/second half measurements
   - Suggests insufficient equilibration or autocorrelation issues

## Recommendations

1. **Parameter Tuning**
   - Use finite-size scaling to find exact critical point for N=48
   - Current (β=2.91, α=1.48) may be off the critical ridge
   - Consider scanning nearby parameters

2. **Initialization**
   - Current random initialization may be too far from critical state
   - Consider starting with intermediate values of θ and z
   - Use configuration from previous successful run

3. **Step Sizes**
   - Increase delta_z to 0.3-0.5
   - Increase delta_theta to 0.3-0.5
   - Monitor acceptance to target 45-55%

4. **Equilibration**
   - Increase to 100k-200k steps for N=48
   - Monitor convergence of key observables
   - Use autocorrelation time to set measurement intervals

## Usage

Before production runs:
```bash
cargo run --release --bin quick_validation
```

All tests should pass before trusting simulation results. The validation test helps catch:
- Numerical issues (NaN/Inf)
- Detailed balance violations
- Performance regressions
- Convergence problems

## Next Steps

1. Implement finite-size scaling analysis to find exact critical parameters
2. Add autocorrelation time estimation to the validation
3. Create reference data from known-good implementation
4. Add more physics checks (e.g., fluctuation-dissipation relation)

The optimized code is numerically stable and fast, but needs careful parameter tuning to reproduce correct physics at the critical point.
