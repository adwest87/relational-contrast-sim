# Relational Contrast Simulation Project Summary

## Overview
A high-performance Monte Carlo simulation framework for studying a novel statistical mechanics model with U(1) phase variables on complete graphs, exhibiting unconventional quantum spin liquid behavior.

## Model
- **Variables**: U(1) phases θᵢⱼ ∈ [0, 2π] on edges of complete graphs
- **Hamiltonian**: H = α∑(triangles) cos(θᵢⱼ + θⱼₖ + θᵢₖ) - β∑(links) S(wᵢⱼ)
- **Key Feature**: Competition between triangle constraints and entropy maximization

## Technical Implementation
- **Language**: Rust with multiple optimization levels
- **Architectures**: 
  - Generic CPU implementation
  - Apple M1-optimized (Accelerate framework)
  - GPU acceleration (Metal shaders)
- **Performance**: Up to 10M+ Monte Carlo steps/second on M1

## Key Findings
1. **Unconventional Physics**: 
   - Quantum spin liquid-like behavior in a classical system
   - Extensive ground state degeneracy (finite entropy as T→0)
   - No conventional phase transition

2. **Critical Region**:
   - Ridge-like critical manifold at α ≈ 0.06β + 1.31
   - Maximum susceptibility χ ~ 35-40 at N=96
   - Saturating finite-size scaling

3. **Novel Universality Class**:
   - Not Ising, XY, or Heisenberg
   - Possible topological order
   - Frustrated interactions prevent symmetry breaking

## Applications & Impact
- New paradigm for classical frustrated systems
- Potential experimental realizations in:
  - Artificial spin ice
  - Photonic metamaterials
  - Cold atom systems
- Connections to quantum information and topological phases

## Tools Developed
