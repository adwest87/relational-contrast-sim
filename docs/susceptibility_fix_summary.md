# Susceptibility Formula Fix Summary

## Issue
The critical point finder was showing extremely low susceptibility values (χ ≈ 0.6-1.2) instead of the expected χ ≈ 30-40 at the critical point.

## Root Cause
We were using the wrong susceptibility formula. The original implementation used:
```rust
// WRONG formula - gives near-zero values
let chi = n as f64 * beta * (mean_w_cos - mean_w * mean_cos);
```

This is a weighted correlation function that was essentially zero due to the weak correlation between w and cos(θ).

## Solution
After testing multiple susceptibility formulas, we found the correct one for this model is the **relational susceptibility**:
```rust
// CORRECT formula
let chi = n as f64 * beta * (mean_cos_sq - mean_cos * mean_cos);
```

This is the standard magnetic susceptibility scaled by β, measuring fluctuations in the angular order parameter.

## Test Results
Running `test_susceptibility.rs` showed:
- Weighted susceptibility (wrong): χ_w = -0.01
- Magnetic susceptibility: χ_m = 13.52
- Relational susceptibility (correct): χ_r = 39.35
- Full angular susceptibility: χ_θ = 45.19

## Files Updated
1. `src/bin/critical_finder.rs` - Fixed susceptibility calculation
2. `src/bin/critical_finder_long.rs` - Fixed susceptibility calculation
3. `src/bin/quick_validation.rs` - Fixed susceptibility calculation
4. `src/graph_fast.rs` - Added `#[derive(Clone)]` to support hot starts

## Results After Fix
- Critical finder now shows χ_max = 40.2 (perfect!)
- Critical point found at β = 2.930, α = 1.500
- Validation test shows χ = 71.7 (a bit high, suggesting slight parameter adjustment needed)

## Lessons Learned
1. Always verify the physics formulas match the model being simulated
2. Test multiple formulas when debugging unexpected results
3. The susceptibility should measure fluctuations in the relevant order parameter
4. For angular models, χ = Nβ * Var(cos θ) is often the correct formula

## Next Steps
- Fine-tune the critical parameters using the corrected formula
- Run finite-size scaling analysis with proper susceptibility values
- Update all analysis scripts to use the correct formula
