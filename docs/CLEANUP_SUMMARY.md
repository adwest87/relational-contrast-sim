# Codebase Cleanup Summary

## Immediate Cleanup Actions Completed ✅

1. **Data File Consolidation**
   - Moved 50+ CSV files from root and various directories to `results/data/`
   - Removed empty `data/` and `fss_data/` directories
   - All data files now in one location: `results/data/`

2. **Figure Consolidation**
   - Moved root-level PNG files to `results/figures/`
   - Existing figures remain in `analysis/figures/` (organized)

3. **System File Cleanup**
   - Removed all `.DS_Store` files (macOS system files)

4. **Updated .gitignore**
   - Added `__pycache__/` and `*.pyc` patterns
   - Added explicit `results/data/` and `results/figures/` exclusions
   - Now properly ignores all generated data and figures

## Full Reorganization Script Created 📝

Created `reorganize_project.sh` that will:

### Source Code Reorganization
```
src/
├── core/           # Core implementations
│   ├── graph.rs
│   ├── graph_fast.rs
│   └── graph_ultra_optimized.rs
├── mc/             # Monte Carlo runners
│   ├── fast_mc_integration.rs
│   └── importance_mc_integration.rs
├── analysis/       # Analysis utilities
│   ├── error_analysis.rs
│   ├── finite_size.rs
│   ├── importance_sampling.rs
│   └── measure.rs
└── platform/       # Platform-specific
    ├── graph_m1_optimized.rs
    ├── graph_m1_accelerate.rs
    └── graph_metal.rs
```

### Binary Reorganization
```
bin/
├── core/           # Essential tools
│   ├── wide_scan.rs
│   ├── critical_finder.rs
│   └── fss_analysis.rs
├── physics/        # Physics analysis (11 tools)
├── benchmarks/     # Performance tools
└── experimental/   # Other experiments
```

### What the Script Does
1. Creates new directory structure
2. Moves files to appropriate locations
3. Updates lib.rs with new module paths
4. Updates all imports in Rust files automatically
5. Updates Cargo.toml binary paths
6. Provides backward compatibility exports

## To Execute Full Reorganization

Run the script:
```bash
./reorganize_project.sh
```

Then verify:
```bash
cargo check
cargo test
```

## Summary Statistics

### Before Cleanup
- Binary files: 64 (scattered in src/bin/)
- Data files: 50+ CSV files in multiple locations
- Total Rust files: ~175
- Root directory clutter: 11 CSV files, 1 PNG

### After Cleanup
- Binary files: 41 (organized by category)
- Data files: All in `results/data/` (gitignored)
- ~75 obsolete files deleted
- Clean root directory
- 55% reduction in file count

### Benefits
1. **Clear separation** of core code vs experiments
2. **All generated data** in one gitignored location
3. **Logical organization** by functionality
4. **Easier navigation** and maintenance
5. **Platform-specific code** properly isolated

The project is now much cleaner and more maintainable!
