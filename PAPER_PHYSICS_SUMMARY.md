# Paper Physics Summary - Relational Contrast Framework

**Note**: I cannot read external papers. This summary is based on information provided in the conversation and existing code comments.

## Core Physics from Available Information

### 1. Fundamental Action

Based on the information provided:
```
S = β ∑_{⟨ij⟩} w_ij ln(w_ij) + α ∑_{⟨ijk⟩} cos(holonomy around triangle)
```

Where:
- w_ij ∈ (0,1] are relational weights
- For U(1) simplified model: holonomy = θ_ij + θ_jk + θ_ki
- β controls entropic effects
- α controls geometric organization

### 2. Key Principles Mentioned

**Dougal Invariance**: 
- Physics invariant under w_ij → λw_ij for all edges
- This is a fundamental symmetry

**Minimal Weight Quantum**:

### 3. Three Axioms
[INFORMATION NOT AVAILABLE - Need paper text]

### 4. Expected Observables

From the conversation, the key observables should be:

1. **Spectral Gap**: Δλ = λ_2 - λ_1 of weighted Laplacian
2. **Effective Dimension**: d_eff = -2 ln(N) / ln(Δλ)
3. **Weight Statistics**: Distribution and moments of w_ij
4. **Triangle Frustration**: Average of cos(θ_ij + θ_jk + θ_ki)

### 5. Numerical Results/Predictions
[INFORMATION NOT AVAILABLE - Need paper text]

### 6. Coarse-Graining Procedure
[INFORMATION NOT AVAILABLE - Need paper text]

### 7. How 4D Emerges

From available information:
- The spectral gap of the weighted Laplacian determines dimensionality
- At criticality, the gap should correspond to d_eff = 4
- This emerges from the competition between entropy and geometric terms

## What We Know from Code/Conversation

1. **NOT a spin system** - Previous magnetic interpretation was wrong
2. **About emergent spacetime** - Not condensed matter physics
3. **Gauge fields emerge** - Full model has SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)
4. **Entropy drives disconnection** - w → 0 maximizes entropy
5. **Geometry organizes** - Triangle term creates structure

## Missing Information

Without access to the paper, I cannot provide:
- Exact page numbers and quotes
- The three axioms
- Minimal weight quantum details
- Specific numerical predictions
- Coarse-graining procedure details
- Complete derivations

To complete this summary, you would need to provide the relevant excerpts from the paper.
