**Key Insight**: Regular graphs show slightly better spectral gaps, explaining their superior performance.

### Edge Density Requirements

**Minimum Viable Density**: 10% connectivity sufficient for 4D emergence  
**Optimal Density Range**: 20-50% provides best performance  
**Diminishing Returns**: Complete connectivity (100%) offers no advantage over dense connectivity

## üéØ Theoretical Implications

### Revised Framework Understanding

**Previous Claim**: Complete graphs uniquely necessary for 4D emergence  
**Empirical Finding**: Dense graphs (>10% connectivity) sufficient for 4D emergence  
**New Understanding**: Framework more general and robust than initially theorized

### Why This Strengthens the Theory

1. **Robustness Demonstrated**: 4D emergence is not fragile or topology-dependent
2. **Universal Phenomenon**: Dimensional emergence appears fundamental to weight dynamics
3. **Practical Viability**: Framework scalable to realistic network sizes
4. **Natural Emergence**: No special connectivity required beyond minimum density

### Physical Interpretation

The success of sparse graphs suggests that **4D spacetime emergence is a robust attractor** in the space of weighted graph dynamics, not an artifact of complete connectivity. This strengthens confidence in the framework's physical relevance.

## üìà Performance Analysis

### Why Sparse Graphs Excel

1. **Better Spectral Structure**: Regular graphs have cleaner eigenvalue spectra
2. **Reduced Over-Constraint**: Complete graphs may be over-determined
3. **Optimal Information Flow**: Moderate connectivity preserves geometric relationships
4. **Computational Efficiency**: O(N) vs O(N¬≤) scaling advantage

### Topology Rankings by Performance

1. **Regular Graphs** (k=20): Best overall performance
2. **Dense Random** (p‚â•0.3): Consistently good
3. **Complete Graphs**: Reliable but not optimal  
4. **Small-World**: Good performance with clustering
5. **Sparse Random** (p=0.1): Works but less reliable

## üöÄ Practical Recommendations

### For Different Use Cases

**Theoretical Work**: 
- Use complete graphs for clean mathematical analysis
